# Parallel NBody

##### HPC 3rd assignment for DSSC Master

This project has been created for the third assignment of the course in High Performance Computing of the DSSC Master course in Trieste. It is not an accurate physical representation of the analyzed system; the focus of the project is on the parallel implementation of the system.

## The folder structure
You can find the source codes in the src directory, as well as a makefile to compile them. In the scripts directory you can find the useful scripts for the code running; the folder data will contain the data file generated by the scripts

## Practical usage

The simplest usage of the code is:

1. cd into the scripts directory
2. ./times
3. ./hybrid run (only for the hybrid code)

If one may want to run individually the openmp or mpi version of the code for a single value of number of parallel regions (p) (processes/tasks, according to the version) and for a single value of number of particles (N):

1. cd into the scripts directory
2. ./run [openmp/mpi] [p] [N]

I would advise to cd into data folder and remove all the files before re-running the code.

In order to visualize the particles the user can use the python notebook dataVisualization.ipynb in the script folder. After executing the instructions presented above the user can open the notebook and execute the cells of interest in order to get a 3d visualization of the particles at the selected stage. It is advisable not to run it for $N > 10^3 $
